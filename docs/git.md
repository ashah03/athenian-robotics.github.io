A good [Git](https://git-scm.com) tutorial is 
[here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## Installation

### OSX 

Install git on OSX with:
```bash
$ brew install git
```

### ev3dev and Raspi
````bash
$ sudo apt-get install git
````

## Cloning a Repo

Clone a repo from [Athenian Robotics](https://github.com/athenian-robotics) with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/athenian-robotics/ev3dev-python-intro.git
```

To find the URL for a particular repo, go to it's github page and 
click on the `Clone or download` button and copy the URL in the pop-up
window. Make sure that the repo URL begins with `https:` and not `git:`. 
You can toggle between the two versions by clicking on `Use HTTPS` and `Use SSH`.
