# Ubuntu Notes

## Networking

To determine the IP addressof the Ubunutu instance, use:

```bash
$ ifconfig -a | grep addr
```

Using ssh to connect to Ubuntu is much better than using the Ubuntu console
because OSX Terminal support s copy and paste.

Download Ubuntu MATE 16.04.2 LTS for Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 systems from [here](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/)

Open the downloaded file with [Keka](http://www.kekaosx.com/en/)

Run `sudo raspi-config` to expand the filesystem.
