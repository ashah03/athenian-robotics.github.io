# 9-DOF Sensor Notes

The Adafruit 9-DOF sensor can be purchased [here](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2472).

The Adafruit 9-DOF sensor docs are [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor).

Sensor calibration is described [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor-with-raspberry-pi-and-beaglebone-black/webgl-example?embeds=allow#sensor-calibration).

Running BNO055 sketches requires two libraries to be installed with 
the Arduino Library Manager (under menu items Sketch-->Include Library):

* *Adafruit BNO055*
* *Adafruit Unified Sensor*
